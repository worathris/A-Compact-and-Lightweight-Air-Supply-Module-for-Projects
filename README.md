## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a compact air tank integrated with a pressure regulator module, designed to deliver stable, adjustable, and safely limited pneumatic pressure for low-pressure applications. The system combines a lightweight air reservoir with a regulator and standard pneumatic interfaces, forming a standalone air supply unit suitable for laboratory use, rapid prototyping, and educational demonstrations.

The project emphasizes modularity, portability, and controllability, making it ideal for experimental pneumatic systems where conventional compressed air infrastructure is impractical.

## ⚙️ System Description

The air tank serves as the compressed air storage unit, while the integrated regulator module ensures controlled and consistent output pressure. The regulator decouples the outlet pressure from fluctuations in tank pressure, allowing reliable operation of downstream pneumatic components.

The module can be extended with sensors or programmable control units; however, the core contribution of this project is the integration of an air tank and regulator into a compact and portable module.
